For example, an icon of a trash can for deleting files, or a floppy disk for the save functionality. It was useful because of its design affordance: a shape that suggests its use. Since graphical interfaces on the computer were new. Computer interfaces would be much more intuitive with skeuomorphism Skeuomorphism designs often had beveled edges, gradients, and reflections."
